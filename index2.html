        <h2>Hi, I'm Angel and you're watching Disney Channel! </h2>
        <p> Okay, maybe I'm not fulfilling my biggest childhood
            dream, but this is a close second. Ever since I was little, I
            wanted to be an artist. And right now, as a third-year CS major at Georgia Tech,
            I'm using technology to create people-centered designs. Which I think is pretty awesome.
        </p>
        <p> I'm currently seeking internships in UX, UI, and Product Design for Summer 2019.
            Here is a copy of my <a href="12.17.18.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
