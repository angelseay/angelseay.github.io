            <h2 style="font-weight: bold">Escape the Syllabus (CS 3311), August 2018 - Present</h2>

            <h3>Task</h3>
            <p>
            Our group, Team Skedaddle, was asked to create a mobile app for students and
            professors that included a syllabus and learning outcomes in the form of
            a game. Our client, Dr. Laquana Cooke, asked us to use Unity as our
            development platform.
            </p>
            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>
            Before we began developing ideas, we consulted our users. After all, we were
            building a product for them and not ourselves. We used convenience sampling while conducting interviews and distributed a survey to students on Georgia Tech's
            campus. My main tasks in this process were
            identifying the key issues, interviewing one of our potential users, and helping
                create the interview guide. The key issues we wanted to explore were: demand for product, student priorities, and language barriers. Here are our results:
                <h4><i>International Students:</i></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Half of the international students did not have questions about the syllabus. The other half that did have questions either talked to the professor/TA directly, or emailed the professor/TA. None of the international students had issues with language barriers. </li>
                    <li>About 90% felt the need to familiarize the syllabus, and experienced inconvenience or disadvantage of not knowing the syllabus. </li>
                    <li>About 75% felt that grading policy was the most important part of the syllabus. 50% felt that office hours was the most important. About 25% felt that course material was the most important.</li>
                    <li>About 50% had professors that utilized games in their class, and they felt that it was helpful to keep students engaged.</li>
                    <li>About 50% think that they would play a game on the syllabus, because it would be more entertaining. The rest of them feel that it would be useless because reading the syllabus is more straightforward and less time-consuming.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><i>Non-International Students:</i></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Students value grading criteria and a list of important dates.</li>
                    <li>Games werenâ€™t used that often in class, but when they were, they were entertaining. The games had more of a question and answer, informal style. The games were memorable and helped students understand material.</li>
                    <li>Students would be interested in playing a mobile syllabus game if they had an incentive (i.e. extra credit). They would rather look at PDF since it saves time. However, they are willing to try the app at least once and see how engaging it is from there.</li>
                    <li>Without an incentive, students were divided on whether the game was worth their while. </li>
                </ul>

                </p>
            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>First, we created <a target="_blank" href="escape_the_syllabus/userstories.pdf">user stories and acceptance criteria </a>. This helped us get an idea of how the app would look and different interactions we wanted the user to have.
            </p>
            <p>Then, we moved on to low-fidelity prototypes.</p>
