                  <li>They had several reasons for learning music: it was fun and provided outlets for self-expression, creativity, collaboration, and feelings of accomplishment. </li>
                  <li> The majority of students learn music outside of school through listening, lessons, YouTube videos, books, and gigs.</li>
                  <li>Those who did not learn music outside of school either wanted to learn or didn‚Äôt have enough time. </li>
                  <li>Guitar tabs, sheet music, and teachers have been beneficial resources. </li>
                  <li>Students disliked ‚Äúrepeating songs over and over again‚Äù and not being able to choose what they played. </li>
                  <li>They complained about the varying levels of players; when their peers didn‚Äôt practice, they felt held back.</li>
