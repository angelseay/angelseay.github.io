      <!-- <h3>Project Proposal and Literature Review</h3> -->
      <h4>Project Proposal</h4>


    <p>During the fall semesters high school drumline students work hard to learn playing technique, how to prepare for a half-time show, and other music. While spring training practices are in place, not everyone is able to attend consistently due to varying commitments. Implementing an alternative form of teaching and learning would give more options for students to keep their playing in shape.</p>

    <!-- <p>During our literature review, we learned more about music education and different tools being used today. </p> -->

    <h4>User Research</h4>
    <p>To understand their level of interest and engagement with traditional music methods and instruction, we distributed a survey. Here are some key findings:</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <ul>

          <li>We found that many students preferred performing when given the options of performing, composing, or both.</li> <li>They had several reasons for learning music: it was fun and provided outlets for self-expression, creativity, collaboration, and feelings of accomplishment. </li>
          <li> The majority of students learn music outside of school through listening, lessons, YouTube videos, books, and gigs.</li>
          <li>Those who did not learn music outside of school either wanted to learn or didn’t have enough time. </li>
          <li>Guitar tabs, sheet music, and teachers have been beneficial resources. </li>
          <li>Students disliked “repeating songs over and over again” and not being able to choose what they played. </li>
          <li>They also complained about the varying levels of players; when their peers didn’t practice, they felt held back.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Learning Goals</h4>
    To introduce informal methods of music education to marching band drummers, preparing them for the upcoming drumline season.
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <ul>
          <li>Allows marching band drummers to practice outside of school and relate it to what is being rehearsed in school spring rehearsals.</li>
          <li>Provides marching band drummers with the required skills needed to succeed in the season and have a head start.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h4>Early Prototyping</h4>





<!-- </div> -->


<p>We focused on five key concepts:</p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
  <ol>
    <li>Interest-based learning</li>
    <li>Informal learning</li>
    <li>Connected learning</li>
    <li>Constructionist approach to learning</li>
    <li>Personal connections</li>
  </ol>
</div>
</div>
  We began brainstorming. We definitely wanted this to be an app that students could relate to, so a social aspect was crucial. I drew some sketches and we created our first prototype in Adobe XD. It covered login, registration, uploading content, and viewing content based on interests or instructor recommendations.
  <div style="text-align: center;">

<!-- </div> -->



<p></p>
<h4> What Worked and What Didn't</h4>
Another team member interviewed roughly 25 drumline students, split in groups of approximately 3 or 4. Within the small groups, each individual was asked to perform one of four specific tasks:
<p></p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
<ol>
  <li>Login</li>
  <li>Find an instructor video</li>
  <li>Find a video based on personal preference</li>
  <li>Post a video</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
The students were asked to think out loud so we could see how they interacted with the application.
<p>Students said that our app was good for not having time to go see instructors. Our tabs for interests and instructor recommended content were also well received. Students liked that our app was aimed at helping them find they want, whether it was a certain category or based on their skillset. In terms of UI design, students believed that our app was easy to navigate. They also liked the simple color scheme.</p>
<p>We didn’t quite make it clear as to what tab the user was on and also the process of posting new content wasn’t very intuitive. We later streamlined the login process and provided clear options to make the process of posting content more intuitive. While the app gives a platform for instructors to provide feedback on content posted by the students, it is not in real time. Another aspect we realized was lacking in the overall design was that we didn’t provide a clear distinction between the students’ view and the instructors’ view, having built a prototype only for the student view and not the instructor view. Another feature lacking in the overall design was search functionality.</p>
<p>We also learned that one of the students was actually red-green color blind. Because it is important for our prototype to be accessible, we made sure to change our color scheme. The color blind student recommended light blue since it is one of the colors that most color blind individuals are able to see.</p>

    <h4>Final Prototype and Future Work</h4>
    <p>Here is a copy of our <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/01393f9c-d920-416e-63ea-27b600e0cc06-7708/">final prototype</a>.
    </p>
    <p> For our design to be successful, we need to create an instructor view. It would be valuable because instructors will help moderate content, recommend resources for students based on their skills, and also post content. Instructor feedback is beneficial because we could learn how to integrate the app with the school’s curriculum and the instructor’s initial teaching methods. </p>
      <p>Another possible feature is real time feedback to help facilitate learning for the students played their piece. This could be in the form of providing sheet music to refer to when learning a new piece. We could also include real time monitoring to see if the correct note is being played.</p>
<p>
Future design iterations may also include a search feature.  We initially believed this wouldn’t be necessary because the scale of our app is so small. However, as more content is added to the application, students may find it useful to have more tailored videos and resources.
