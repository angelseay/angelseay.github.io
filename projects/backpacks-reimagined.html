            <h4>Task</h4>
            <p>
            Our group, Team Possible, was asked to redesign an everyday object. We chose the backpack. Although this course focused more on a user interface in a digital sense, we found that our users didn't see that as a need. We applied common UI principles to our physical design.
            </p>
            <h4>User Research</h4>
            <p>
              We began by brainstorming a list of stakeholders and narrowed it down to three groups that we believed had the most concerns: college students, commuters, and working professionals.
            </p>

            <p>
               We first <b>recorded observations</b> at different locations: on the bus, in the classroom, in our apartments, during class changes, etc. Next, we did a <b>competitive analysis</b> by looking at news articles, research articles, and Amazon reviews of backpacks. We created affinity notes based on user praises and concerns. For notes that were unclear, we decided to seek more information. This was the basis for our interview scripts and survey questions.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
              Note: Looking back now, this method of convenience sampling was not ideal and may not have been representative of the different stakeholder groups.
            </p> -->
            <!-- <p>
              After gathering the data from interviews and surveys, we generated more affinity notes and grouped them using a bottom-up approach.
            </p> -->
            <!-- affinity map picture -->
            <img class="d-block w-50" style="margin: 0 auto;display: block; "src="../img/backpacks-reimagined/affinity-map.jpg"></a>
            <p> </p>
            <p>
              <b>We settled on three key themes: external structure, what's inside the backpack, and traveling with the backpack.</b>
            </p>
            <p>More info on our <a href="../project-src-files/backpacks-reimagined/P1-Deliverable.pdf">user research process</a>.</p>

            <h4>Ideation</h4>
            <p>
              We established four design criteria (which would later be modified): <b>Versatility, Safety, Convenience, and Comfort</b>. When we first looked at our user data we simply grouped affinity notes by how similar they were and not on the specific concerns of the user. These new criteria address issues that we found during our user research.
            </p>
            <h5>Divergence</h5>
            <p>
              To brainstorm ideas for our backpack designs, we used a combination of individual and group sessions.
              <!-- In total, we did four rounds of brainstorming: two rounds individually and two rounds as a group.
              We started off individually and generated about 40 ideas total. Next, we completed group brainstorming in class. To do this, we discussed the ideas that we came up with individually and branched off of some of those ideas while also coming up with new ones. Through this second round of brainstorming, we came up with approximately 40 more ideas. Once group brainstorming was completed, we individually added more ideas to our list to get us to at least 100. We did one last round as a group to make sure we reviewed the new ideas and gave each other another chance to bounce off of these. -->
            </p>
            <h5>Convergence</h5>
            <p>
              We clustered the 100 ideas into groups based on what problem they solved. To do that, we first removed any that were unfeasible or didn't solve a relevant backpack issue. We voted on ideas and tried to figure out the best aspects of each, how they fulfilled the design criteria, or if ideas could be combined.

               <!-- These top ideas were grouped into four categories based on the problems they addressed: safety, customization, versatility, and durability. After discussion we decided to move forward with the first three groups because we thought the durability concerns would be better addressed as a materials problem than our design. It also did not specifically address our design criteria. -->

               We decided to focus on one backpack that would enhance the safety of its user, one that could have fully customizable organization, and one that used technology to conveniently improve little moments in everyday life.
            <p>
            <h6>Summary of Three Ideas</h6>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Build-A-Backpack</b>: ​This backpack will be fully customizable to the individual user’s needs. Featuring various pockets that can zip together, it will allow each user to add or remove pockets based on what they need in that moment.

            <h4>Prototype</h4>
            <p>For our final prototype, we listened to feedback from our in-class critique. We settled on three final criteria: <b> Versatility, Individual Safety, and Convenience </b>.
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col">
                  <h5> Build-a-Backpack Feedback </h5>
                  <p> + Modularity </p>
                  <p> + Customizability </p>
                  <p> - Uneven weight distribution </p>
                  <p> - Zippers may ruin the style </p>
                  <p> - Seems easy to steal a component </p>

                </div>
                <div class="col">
                  <h5> Backpack Night Mode Feedback </h5>
                  <p> - Doesn't address accidental calls to police </p>
                  <p> - Unclear how the alarm button would be pressed </p>
                  <p> - Reflective material may affect the style </p>

                </div>
                <div class="col">
                  <h5> Tech Pack Feedback </h5>
                  <p> + Convenience of solar panel </p>
                  <p> - Increase costs </p>
                  <p> - Overheating </p>

              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col">
                  <h5> Recommendations</h5>
                  <p> Single retractable pocket addresses criteria of customizability and convenience without the complexity and cost of a fully modular backpack. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                  <h5> Recommendations</h5>
                  <p> Rather than a single press or a long press, the user will now program a pattern when they get the backpack to avoid accidental presses and a separate process for undoing calls.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                  <h5> Recommendations</h5>
                  <p>We will exclude the phone-locking pocket due to concerns about emergencies and redundancy with existing phone apps. </p>
                </div>

            <h4>Evaluation</h4>
            <p>We evaluated our prototype through heuristic evaluation and running several focus groups.</p>
            <p>Several parts of our final design showed evidence of being successful solutions to the problem we focused on. We found that the lights contributed to not only safety, but also versatility. Participants in our focus groups thought the lights were good for visibility and told us that they would use the lights when they got to their room and it was dark. It would also be more convenient for them to use than a phone flashlight. Potential users also believed that the retractable pocket would be good for placing their keys and accessing smaller items. They thought that the solar charger would be good for when they were traveling. This shows evidence that certain parts of our final design were successful.</p>
            <p>
There are still some parts of our design that do not have a sufficient solution. Our focus groups revealed issues that our design team did not consider. The lights on the backpack can be activated one at a time. However, it is uncommon that the user would need only one light on. Instead of pressing both, a new iteration of the prototype could have a simple switch that would activate/deactivate both lights. Participants in the focus groups also had concerns about the silent alarm. We believe we should conduct additional user research to figure out if users prefer the silent alarm over one that makes sound. We still need to figure out the logistics on how the alarm works: if it is a phone call or simply sends a GPS location and who the location is sent to. Is it the nearest police station or 9-1-1 operators or just a friend of the person that owns the backpack? Either way, the alarm will need some sort of battery. It might even be connected to the solar charger. As of now, most of our time was spent developing each stand-alone feature and not how they may interact with each other. We don’t have clear solutions to these parts of the problem yet, but more discussions with our stakeholders will help us determine if our product fulfills our design criteria. </p>
