            <li> We voted on ideas and tried to figure out the best aspects of each, how they fulfilled the design criteria, or if ideas could be combined. </li>

        <h4>üí¨ Heuristic evaluations and focus groups </h4>
      </div>
      <div class="col-8">

          <h5>The Good</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>We found that the lights contributed to not only safety, but also versatility.</li>
              <li>Participants in our focus groups thought the lights were good for visibility and told us that they would use the lights when they got to their room and it was dark. </li>
              <li>Potential users also believed that the retractable pocket would be good for placing their keys and accessing smaller items.</li>
              <li> They thought that the solar charger would be good for when they were traveling.</li>
            </ul>

          <h5>Current Issues</h5>
            <ul>
              <li> The lights on the backpack can be activated one at a time. However, it is uncommon that the user would need only one light on. Instead of pressing both, a new iteration of the prototype could have a simple switch that would activate/deactivate both lights.</li>
              <li>More concerns about the silent alarm. We believe we should conduct additional user research to figure out if users prefer the silent alarm over one that makes sound. We still need to figure out the logistics on how the alarm works: if it is a phone call or simply sends a GPS location and who the location is sent to. Is it the nearest police station or 9-1-1 operators or just a friend of the person that owns the backpack? Either way, the alarm will need some sort of battery. It might even be connected to the solar charger.</li>
              <li> Most of our time was spent developing each stand-alone feature and not how they may interact with each other. We don‚Äôt have clear solutions to these parts of the problem yet, but more discussions with our stakeholders will help us determine if our product fulfills our design criteria.</li>
            </ul>
