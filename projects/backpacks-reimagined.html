                  Backpacks Reimagined

                <h5>User Interface Design, August 2018 - December 2018</h5>

              </div>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Task</h3>
            <p>
            Our group, Team Possible, was asked to redesign an everyday object. We chose the backpack. Although this course focused more on a user interface in a digital sense, we found that our users didn't see that as a need. We applied common UI principles to our physical design.
            </p>
            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>
              We began by brainstorming a list of stakeholders and narrowed it down to three groups that we believed had the most concerns: college students, commuters, and working professionals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our first step was to familiarize ourselves with the users. We first recorded observations at different locations: on the bus, in the classroom, in our apartments, during class changes, etc. Next, we did a competitive analysis by looking at news articles, research articles, and Amazon reviews of backpacks. We began creating affinity notes based on user praises and concerns. For notes that were unclear, we decided to seek more information. This was the basis for our interview scripts and survey questions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: Looking back now, this method of convenience sampling was not ideal and may not have been representative of the different stakeholder groups.
            </p>
            <p>
              After gathering the data from interviews and surveys, we generated more affinity notes and grouped them using a bottom-up approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              We settled on three key themes: external structure, what's inside the backpack, and traveling with the backpack.
            </p>

            <!-- affinity map picture -->
            <img class="d-block w-100" src="../img/backpacks-reimagined/affinity-map.jpg"></a>

            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>
              In this stage of the process, we established four design criteria (which would later be modified): Versatility, Safety, Convenience, and Comfort. When we first looked at our user data we simply grouped affinity notes by how similar they were and not on the specific concerns of the user. These new criteria address issues that we found during our user research.
            </p>
            <h4>Divergence</h4>
            <p>
              To brainstorm ideas for our backpack designs, we used a combination of individual and group sessions.
              <!-- In total, we did four rounds of brainstorming: two rounds individually and two rounds as a group.
              We started off individually and generated about 40 ideas total. Next, we completed group brainstorming in class. To do this, we discussed the ideas that we came up with individually and branched off of some of those ideas while also coming up with new ones. Through this second round of brainstorming, we came up with approximately 40 more ideas. Once group brainstorming was completed, we individually added more ideas to our list to get us to at least 100. We did one last round as a group to make sure we reviewed the new ideas and gave each other another chance to bounce off of these. -->
            </p>
            <h4>Convergence</h4>
            <p>
              We clustered the 100 ideas into groups based on what problem they solved. To do that, we first removed any that were unfeasible or didn't solve a relevant backpack issue. We voted on ideas and tried to figure out the best aspects of each, how they fulfilled the design criteria, or if ideas could be combined.

               <!-- These top ideas were grouped into four categories based on the problems they addressed: safety, customization, versatility, and durability. After discussion we decided to move forward with the first three groups because we thought the durability concerns would be better addressed as a materials problem than our design. It also did not specifically address our design criteria. -->

               We decided to focus on one backpack that would enhance the safety of its user, one that could have fully customizable organization, and one that used technology to conveniently improve little moments in everyday life.
            <p>
            <h5>Summary of Three Ideas</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Build-A-Backpack: ​This backpack will be fully customizable to the individual user’s needs. Featuring various pockets that can zip together, it will allow each user to add or remove pockets based on what they need in that moment.
              </li>
              <li>Backpack Night Mode:​ Safety consistently is a great concern for many user. This backpack will provide comfort to the user when walking alone late at night.
              </li>
              <li>Tech Pack:​ As we move toward a more technologically heavy society, it is important that people constantly have access to power. This pack is meant to make the live of students more convenient by giving them the ability to charge their various devices on the go.
