            Here's a little info about me: </p>
        <p>
            I became interested in computer science after attending several programming summer camps and taking a few web dev courses. This new approach to problem solving really interested me. However, at the time, I was more fascinated with the artistic side: graphic design. So when it came time for me to choose my major, I found the one that allowed me to combine my knack for problem solving with my passion for art. I knew that as a creator I wanted to use any platform I could to help others. And the methods and disciplines of Tech's computer science program perfectly aligned with that.

            I am REALLY into music. If you ever want some new tunes, check out my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/justmaybe?si=sTsvq7uyTcmrQA_m3_9chw"> Spotify</a> profile. I tend to remember music based on the feeling I had or the place I was when I first heard it. So I document these moments, kind of like a diary, in monthly playlists!
        </p>
        <p>
            In my spare time, I enjoy reading, drawing, painting, doing DIY projects, eating chocolate cake, discovering new music, and watching Marvel series on Netflix.
