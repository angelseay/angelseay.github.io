            ☆ Here's a little info about me: </p>
        <p>
            ☺ I became interested in computer science after attending several programming summer camps in high school. This new approach to problem solving really interested me. However, at the time, I was more fascinated with the artistic side: graphic design. So when it came time for me to choose my major, I found the one that allowed me to combine my knack for problem solving with my passion for art. I knew that as a creator I wanted to use any platform I could to help others. And the methods and disciplines of Tech's computer science program and my threads, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/content/media">Media</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/content/people">People</a>, perfectly aligned with that.

            ♫ I breathe music. I'm that annoying friend always quoting song lyrics (especially Disney!). If you ever want some new tunes, check out my <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/justmaybe?si=sTsvq7uyTcmrQA_m3_9chw"> Spotify</a> profile. I tend to remember music based on the feeling I had or the place I was when I first heard it. So I document these moments, kind of like a diary, in monthly playlists!
        </p>
        <p>
            ☀ In my spare time, I enjoy reading, drawing, painting, doing DIY projects, eating chocolate cake, discovering new music, and watching Marvel series on Netflix.
